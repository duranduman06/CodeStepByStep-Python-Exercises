"""
Write a function named max_value that accepts a list of integers as a parameter and returns the maximum value in the list. 
For example, if a list named nums passed stores [17, 7, -1, 26, 3, 9], the call of max_value(nums) should return 26.
You may assume that the list contains at least one element. Your function should not modify the elements of the list.
